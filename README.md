# What is Synapse X Revive?
Synapse X Revive is a Roblox Studio Executor, very cool!

# Does it have HttpGet?
Yes, if you would like to test it here is a Hello World test:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://pastebin.com/raw/gxMGawaG"))()
```

# How do I set it up?
Download the main, by clicking **Code** and then **Download Zip**, then extract it and open **open.bat**, then after everything is installed, open main.py (if it does not work open it in Visual Studio Code and run it)
then, insert the rbxm file into ur game, and ungroup the folders where it tells you to ungroup. Once done, make sure that you upload the game so you can enable Http Requests. Then open the executor first then run the game in Studio.
Wait for a bit and it should work!

# I can't execute again!
The reason being it will allow only one time execution of the same script (meaning if i did ```print('hi')``` and i tried executing again it wont work, just change it to fix it, its normal)
if its annoying complain to the original owner.

# I love you
